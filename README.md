# Description

This folder contains various projects I have been working on or I am still in the process of developing. Most of the projects comes with a Medium article but I also carefully commented everything for readership purposes.

All the codes are written entirely in Python or R.

*** I published almost exclusively on Towards Data Science publication through Partnership program so please check out these articles as a way to support me and my future projects
